# Classifying solids by using a LSTM model with their meshes points

This project presents a method for classifiyng solids based on their point cloud datasets by using the sequence of points in different planes. 

You can find the code in the /PointNet_code directory via google colab and see the requirments, explainations and results there.

This Medium helped me for implementing this project:
